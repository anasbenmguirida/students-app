This is an online web application for academic tasks, where students and professors can perform several tasks.

Students: They can request administrative documents and consult their grades once they are submitted.

Professors: They can mark attendance for the classes they teach and enter grades for exams based on the subjects they teach.

Administration : admins can process and fulfill student requests for administrative documents.
